# AzureKinectUnityWrapper
Hackathon project for using Azure Kinect depth frames in Unity.
**Note: This project isn't formally supported by Microsoft.**

For this project to run, you need to obtain binaries for Azure Kinect SDK v1.3.0.
https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md

Add the *.dll files for this SDK to your Unity Editor folder. This means, copy the content from
`C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect SDK v1.3.0\sdk\windows-desktop\amd64\release\bin\*`
to
`C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2018.3.14f1\Editor\`
